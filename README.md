This README.md file will guide you through the process of integrating the ChatGPT API into your PHP website, with advanced configuration options for the GPT-4 API. In this version, you can fine-tune the API's behavior to better suit your needs while ensuring a more secure and efficient integration.

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher installed on your web server
- A web server with support for PHP (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for designing the chat interface)
- An API key for the ChatGPT API
### New Features in v2.0.0
- Customizable model selection (e.g., "text-davinci-003")
- Adjustable temperature, max tokens, top_p, frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty settings
- Improved security and code organization
### API Key
- Register for an account or log in to the OpenAi platform.
- Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API key.
- Store the API key safely, as you will need it in the next step.
### Setting up the PHP Script
In this version, you'll create a new PHP file that contains advanced configuration options for the GPT-4 API. The existing gptchat.php script needs to be updated to include these new options in the API request.

### Creating a Chat Interface
The chat interface remains the same as in the previous version. You can continue using the same index.html, style.css, and script.js files from the base version (v1.0.0).

### Testing the Chat Functionality
- Upload the updated gptchat.php file along with the index.html, style.css, and script.js files to your web server.
- Access the index.html file in your browser (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/index.html).
- Type a message in the chat input field and press Enter or click the Send button to send the message.
- The ChatGPT API should respond with a message from the language model.
- Be careful and set limits on your OpenAi Dashboard!

That's it! You have successfully integrated the ChatGPT API with advanced configuration options into your PHP website. You can now customize the chat interface and improve the user experience as needed.
